**VARIABLES**

**int** - models arithmetic integers 

```java
int numberOflegs = 8
```

**float** - Decimals

```java
float NumberOflegs=0.04
```

**Boolean** - True/False 

```java
boolean isCloudOutside = true;
```
```java
boolean tempetureIsBelowFreesing = false;
```

!b - the opposite

    Question 2
    
    Select those statements that are correct
    
    - ---
        
        If f1 and f2 are floats and f2 > 0, then f1 + f2 > f1
        
    - ---
        
        Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY - Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY = 0
        
    - ---
        
        If f1 and f2 are floats and f1 is infinite, then f1 + f2 is infinite.
        
    - ---
        
        Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY - Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY = Float.NaN
        
    - ---
        
        Float.NaN * 0 = 0
        
    - ---
        
        Float.NaN * 0 = Float.NaN
