**VARIABLES**

**int** - models arithmetic integer 

```java
int numberOflegs = 8
```
---

**float** -  ( floating-point number)
```java
float NumberOflegs=0.04
```
**The Solution:** A "Floating" point. The decimal point can "float" left or right, allowing the computer to represent very large numbers (like the distance to a star) and very tiny numbers (like the width of an atom) using the same number of bits.

- **Infinity:** Exponent is all 1s, Mantissa is all 0s.
    
- **NaN (Not a Number):** Exponent is all 1s, Mantissa is **not** 0


---

**Boolean** - True/False 

```java
boolean isCloudOutside = true;
```
```java
boolean tempetureIsBelowFreesing = false;
```
