Key Terms
---
**Chemical Bond** - **attraction** of two **atoms** 

**Molecule** - when two or more **atoms** come together **chemically**

**Compound** - two different **elements** come together

**Covalent Bond** 
- two atoms that share electrons to meet the configuration in the outer shell
- Each atom contributes one member of an electron pair
- **Double bond** - atoms share two electron pairs

**NonPolar bond** - **electrons** are shared equally 

**Polar bond** - electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus
	
- The more electronegative it will be negatively charged
- and others are slightly positively charged 

**Ionic Bond** - an high electronegativity atom that pulls from an atom with low electronegativity atom 

**Ions**
---
- Ions gain or lose electrons, which causes them to be **Cations** (+) and **Anions** (-)
 - They attract one another for the reason they have opposite charges
 - Ions also form crystals in which there are regular arrangement between **cations** and **anions** by the attraction of opposite charges of Ions 
 - also water dissolves the strength of the attraction, irrelevant to living organisms

**Dipole** 
---
- separation of two opposite electric charges
- **Dipole - Dipole interactions** - slightly charged atoms that interact with other atoms (weak) 

**Hydrogen Bond**
---
attraction between a slightly positively charged covalently bonded hydrogen and a slightly negatively charged covalently bonded nitrogen or oxygen.

**van der Waals interactions**
--- 
attractions between oppositely charged atoms. Movement of electrons results in small temporary dipoles.  

Very weak, but often many interactions can amount to a significant force, even in polar  
molecules.
