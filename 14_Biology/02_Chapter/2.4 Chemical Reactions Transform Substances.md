**Chemical Reaction**
---

When atoms combine and change bonding partners

Gibbs free energy G
---
The differences in bond energy and the change in entropy determine whether the total energy  
change of the reaction is positive or negative 

If the **G** negative - the reaction releases energy (**exergonic**)

If **G** is positive, the reaction requires energy to occur (**endergonic**)

**Activation Energy** - the energy that is required to initiate a reaction between **chemical transformations** (Ea)

**Ea** - is required in both **exergonic** and **endergonic** reactions because covalent bonds in reactants must be broken 

**Condensation**
---
Reaction is the reverse of **hydrolysis**

glucose + fructose sucrose + H O→   sucrose + H20 

This reaction will have a positive G, meaning it  
requires energy to occur (**endergonic**).
