**Reaction Rates**
---
**Reaction rates are lower when:**
	
**Activation energy is lower**
- Activation energy is the energy barrier that reactions must overcome 
- Lower barrier = easier for reactions to happen 
- So reactions go faster 

**The temperature is higher** 
- higher tempature is faster particles 
- faster particles more often and more energy

**The concentration of reactants is increased**
- This leads to more frequent collisions

**pH**
