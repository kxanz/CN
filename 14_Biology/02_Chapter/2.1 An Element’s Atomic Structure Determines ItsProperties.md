Key Terms 
---
**Atoms** - all matter is composed of atoms 

**Element** -a fundamental substance that consists of just one atom 
- 92 elements

Atoms consist of 3 fundamental particles:
- **Protons** - Positively charged 
- **Electrons** - Negatively charged
- **Neutrons** - uncharged 

**Protons** and **Neutrons** are together in the nucleus
- **Mass Number** - number of neutrons and protons in a nucleus

**Electrons** are rapidly moving outside of the nucleus in **electron shells**

**Atomic Mass** - is measured in Daltons (Da)

**Fundamental elements for living systems**: 
- Hydrogen 
- oxygen 
- nitrogen
- carbon

The number of **protons** (**atomic number**) identifies an element.  

The periodic table shows all the elements in order of **atomic numbe**r.  

Elements in the same column have the same number of electrons in their outermost shell  
(valence shell), which results in their having  similar chemical properties

**Isotopes** are the **neutrons** that differ from the protons of an element

**Electron**s orbit around the **atomic orbit**
	
- Every electron shell has one spherical s orbital.  
Second and subsequent shells also have three p  
orbitals.

**Octet rule**: an atom will lose, gain, or share  
electrons in order to achieve a stable  
configuration of 8 electrons in its outermost shell

**Noble gas** dont react with other elements 

**Electronegativity** - an electron tends to attract other electrons from other atoms
- Higher electrons on the outer shell have the most **electronegavity**
- Electronegativity thus increases from the bottom left to the top right of the periodic table
