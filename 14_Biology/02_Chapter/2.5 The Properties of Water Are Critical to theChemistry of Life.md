Water has a high **specific heat**: the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C.
	
Water has a high **heat of vaporization**—it takes a  great deal of energy to vaporize it

- Water can survive in different types of environmental temperatures 
- Whenever the water evaporates, the heat is removed from the surface of the living things
- Water in living tissues reduces temperature fluctuations experienced because of changes in  
  environmental temperature.

**Ice** - additional hydrogen bonds form, causing more distance between water molecules, making ice less dense than water. Thus, lakes and oceans freeze from top to bottom

**Cohesion** -The attraction of the water molecules for one another to create a **surface tension**
	
**Adhesion** - it attracts water molecules to different molecules especially polar molecules 
	
- **Cohesion** and **adhesion** help plants raise water  
  from the roots to the leaves.

**Universal solvent** - water is called 

**Hydrophilic** - substances that easily dissolve in water 

**Hydrophobic** - substances that dont dissolve easilly in water
