Water has a high **specific heat**: the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C.
	
Water has a high **heat of vaporization**—it takes a  great deal of energy to vaporize it

- Water can survive in different types of environmental temperatures 
- Whenever the water evaporates, the heat is removed from the surface of the living things
- Water in living tissues reduces temperature fluctuations experienced because of changes in  
  environmental temperature.

**Ice** - additional hydrogen bonds form, causing more distance between water molecules, making ice less dense than water. Thus, lakes and oceans freeze from top to bottom

**Cohesion** -The attraction of the water molecules for one another to create a **surface tension**
	
**Adhesion** - it attracts water molecules to different molecules, especially polar molecules 
	
- **Cohesion** and **adhesion** help plants retain water  
  from the roots to the leaves.

**Universal solvent** - water is called 

**Hydrophilic** - substances that easily dissolve in water 

**Hydrophobic** - substances that don't dissolve easily in water 

Ionic compounds, such as NaCl, dissolve in water because the ions become surrounded by water molecules in a **hydration shell.**

**Acids**
---
raise of concentration of H+ions

- When dissolved in water, increasing the concentration of H3O+  relative to OH-

**Bases** - produce proton acceptors such as OH- ions  
when dissolved in water. OH-  ions combine with some of the H3O +, forming water

**pH** of an aqueous solution is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of 
H3O- ions

CO 2 dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, which then ionizes

**Buffer** - This acts as a stabilizes pH: if acid is added, the reaction increases to the left.
- Reducing H3O concentration and raising the PH 
- If base is added, the reaction increases to the right as H3O is removed, decreasing the pH

**Rainwater** is slightly acidic, seawater is basic (8.4)
