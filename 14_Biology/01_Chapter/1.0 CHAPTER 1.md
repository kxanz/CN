**Biology**  

Study of life and living organisms.  All organisms come from one descended ancestor 

**All Characteristics of Living Organisms**

- They all have a similar genetic code of DNA 
- Get their energy from their environment
- composed into a similar chemical component and structure 
- a universal code that is genetically related and evolved 
- Homeostasis- regulates their internal environment in the environment 

**Cell Theory**

- All Cells come from a pre-existing cell
- All Cells have a structured mechanism for the organism 

**Robert Hooke** 

He was known for coming up with the word "cells"

**Antonie van Leeuwenhoek**

Known as the "father of microscopy."

**The History of Evolution of Life**

**Nucleic Acids** - reproduce and contain information about proteins

**Membranes** are fatty acids that enclose cells 

**Prokaryotes** - Cells that were from a long time ago, which do not have a nucleus, in which where in the ocean, so they won't get damaged by the uv light 

**Eukaryotes** do have a nucleus 

**Photosynthesis** has evolved over 2.5 billion years, creating the Ozone layer for organisms to breath 0^2

**aerobic metabolism** - cellular respiration, which most living organisms use today, USES OXYGEN

**Metabolism** - the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in cells.

**Endosymbiosis**

- **Mitochondria** - energy production 

- **Chloroplast** - a plant cell in which the main cause of photosynthesis is

**Cellular specialization** —cells became specialized to perform a certain function, which allows cells to adapt and become larger to make speific functions 

**The three domains of life:**
- Bacteria 
- Archaea
- Eukarya - Eukarya came from Achaea

**0^3 O Zone** - blocked Uv Light so life can be moved to life
