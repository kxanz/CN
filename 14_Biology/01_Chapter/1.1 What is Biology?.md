**study of life**

**Living Organisms**

- common set in chemicals, components, and structures
- Universal code, they are all related and evolved 
- converted molecules obtained from the environment into new biological molecules 
- extract energy from the environment for life functions
- replicated genetic information

**What** **is** **Cell Theory?**

 All cells coordinate from preexisting cells and share a similar chemical composition.
 
 Most chemical reactions of life occur within cells. 

**Sulfolobus**

Grow in a volcanic spring with optimal growth at pH 2-3 and temperatures of 75

**Critical Step for Evolution**

formation of nucleic acids that produce themselves and contrain info to produce proteins.

Complex biological molecules may have arisen from the random association of chemicals in the early environment

**Questions?**

In the course of evolution, fatty acids were the critical  
An ingredient in the enclosure of biological molecules in  
membranous films because these molecules

(b) are not soluble in water

Which is **NOT** characteristic of most living organisms 

(C) Ability to change traits according to their needs 

An abundance of2O led to the evolution?

(b) aerobic eukaryotes

**CELLS**

**Prokaryotes**

confined by oceans and protected from UV light

lack nuclei

**Photosynthesis**

**Metabolism**

The sum of all chemical reactions that occur in cells

**Mitochondria**

**Chloroplasts**

**Endosymbiosis**

**Evo of Species**

- **Mutations** (changes) are introduced when gnome is replicated 
- Some mutations give rise to structural and functional changes in organisms, and new species arise 

Each species has a distinct scientific name, a **binomial** 

**Ex: Homo Sapiens**

**MUTATIONS**

- Alter nucleotide sequence of a gene, and protein can be altered as well
- caused by chemicals and 

**Phylogenetic trees** document and diagram  evolutionary relationships as part of an  
overarching **tree of life**.
